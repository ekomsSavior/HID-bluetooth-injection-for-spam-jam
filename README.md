 Bluetooth HID Injection for spam jam and GeeekPi nRF52840 USB Dongle

The GeeekPi nRF52840 USB Dongle is actually a great choice for Bluetooth HID injection. It‚Äôs based on the Nordic nRF52840 chip,
WHICH:

Fully supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

Can emulate Bluetooth HID devices like keyboards and mice

Is compatible with Adafruit's CircuitPython, nRF Connect SDK, and ZMK / Zephyr OS

Has existing support for HID over GATT (HoG) ‚Äî which is how those stealthy keyboard injections work!

‚úÖ Step 1: Install Adafruit Bootloader
üì¶ Needed Tools:

Zadig for USB driver installation (Windows only)

nrfutil for flashing

The Adafruit nRF52 Bootloader .zip from here:

https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Bootloader/releases

üß™ Instructions :

1. Hold down the reset button and plug the dongle in (it should appear as "DFU mode" or "Unknown USB").

2. Use Zadig to replace the driver with libusb-win32 or WinUSB.

3. Flash the Adafruit bootloader:

nrfutil dfu usb-serial -pkg adafruit_nrf52_bootloader.zip -p COMX

(Replace COMX with the correct port shown in Device Manager)

Once successful, the dongle should reboot and appear as a USB mass storage device.

‚úÖ Step 2: Load a HID Payload in CircuitPython

1. Once you have CircuitPython installed on the dongle (shows up as CIRCUITPY), create this file:

# code.py

import time
import usb_hid
from adafruit_hid.keyboard import Keyboard
from adafruit_hid.keycode import Keycode

kbd = Keyboard(usb_hid.devices)

time.sleep(2)
kbd.send(Keycode.WINDOWS, Keycode.R)
time.sleep(0.5)
kbd.write("notepad\n")
time.sleep(0.5)
kbd.write("HACK THE PLANET üíª‚ú®üåç\n")

2. Save it, eject the drive, and plug the dongle into a test machine with Bluetooth HID support (can test wired first).

NEXT WE WILL :

‚úÖ Confirm the Adafruit bootloader was flashed

‚úÖ Confirm CircuitPython is working

‚úÖ Test HID injection (wired or Bluetooth, depending on available firmware)

If this works, we‚Äôll move on to BLE HID injection using nrf Connect SDK or a custom SoftDevice-based payload. Our final goal is:

üéØ Spam Jam Feature Goal:

A menu to detect compatible nRF52840 dongles

Flash + inject HID BLE payloads wirelessly

Choose from payloads (Notepad, reverse shell, browser macros, emoji spam üíñ)

Toggle BLE keyboard mode inside Spam Jam
